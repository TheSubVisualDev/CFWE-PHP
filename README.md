Cuttlefish Work Experience - Php work
======
*Note: This is a private, small set of php files that are not to be used in any commercial way by myself. These files are solely for my education and self improvement, and not much will probably come from this.*

However.

Cool things are planned for this project, including but not limited to;

-Project briefs from Jon.
-Old .py projects rewritten in Php for web based deployment (Thus becoming compatable on practically all devices)
